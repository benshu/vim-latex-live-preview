## Synopsis

By using a simple makefile and the fswatch program to monitor changes to all .tex files in the working directory, and recompile the .tex file to pdf on every file change.

## Motivation

When editing LaTeX document, it sometimes very helpful to be able to have a live preview of the rendered result.

The content in this repository was inspired by the following video -


## Installation
By using a properly configured pdf viewer it is possible to achieve real time results.

In os x, preview work out of the box, but every refresh cause the document to scroll to top which might be annoying when working on multi page documents. I'm using mu-pdf which allows on the fly updates to the pdf file resulting in real time live preview of the latex document.



A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.
